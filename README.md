# Image-Restoration-and-Enhancement
This web-based application project is designed, developed and implemented using Deep Learning Approach to generate high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts by leveraging the power of deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The model used in this web-based application is GFPGAN.
